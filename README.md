# Reviewer-recommendation-by-experience-and-affinity
Reviewer recommendation by experience and affinity
This Final Master's Project proposes a solution to the paper reviewer proposal required by the Peer Review process specifically accepted by the academic sector. 
The work of the IJIMAI magazine to propose suitable papers to the collaborators is becoming increasingly complex due to the growing amount of articles they are 
receiving. So far, the task is carried out manually and with this project we intend to make this recommendation effectively and precisely, proposing adjusted 
reviewers in the knowledge area of the article under review. Currently there are many unsupervised recommendation methods and for this project was selected 
the WMD metric tool based on vectors generated by neural networks that allows you to calculate the distance between two documents even without having words in common. 
It uses word embedding generated by Word2Vec and calculates the distance by an adaptation of the calculation of the distance of the earth movement (EMD) to the space 
of the documents. The Word2Vec training is updated with the magazine's papers revised and pending papers this action allows us to addition the new concepts that arise
in the research. The information of the reviewers is updated with the reviews that have obtained the best evaluation by the editor. Finally, together with the result 
of the selected reviewers with the shortest distance to the article and their own information, the calculated attributes are obtained, which are the trust that the 
reviewer shows with the journal, the workload of the last 12 months, if the Reviewer is currently undergoing review and alignment with the publisher and what is the 
style of the majority revisions that he has submitted to the journal. With all this information, the publisher will be able to streamline and improve its reviewer 
assignment process.
